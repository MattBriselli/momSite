                <div class="q">Will you play in two different locations for the ceremony and reception?</div>
                <div class="a">Yes.  The fee is calculated from the time we start at the ceremony until the time we end at the reception.  If there is travel time between the two, that is included in the fee.</div>

            <div class="question">
                <div class="q">What do you require at the venue?</div>
                <div class="a">Our only requirement is four armless chairs and enough space, which is roughly 8’ x 8’.  For outdoor weddings and events, we must have a shaded area.  We have our own battery-operated lights if needed, so we do not need electricity.</div>
