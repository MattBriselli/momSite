                    Arioso was everything we hoped for and more. They added just the right touch to our daughters wedding. We had some special requests for songs at the church they were not familiar with and they went above and beyond to learn the music and make the songs special for us. I already told them we wish we had more daughter's weddings to plan. We would definetly be using them again. Thank You Lori and Dan

                        "One of the Best Choices I Made Towards My June 2016 Wedding By FAR."

                    I absolutely loved having the Arioso String Quartet play for my church wedding ceremony! This was one of the best choices I made towards my June 2016 wedding by FAR. Their prices are very reasonable and their communication and professionalism leading up to the big day was the best of ALL my vendors for my wedding. They were very flexible with my indecisiveness and were always happy to offer suggestions or consider my special requests. Despite my church being picky about our music selection and requiring us to change our music choices many times, Arioso was nothing but professional and patient through it all. They were absolutely wonderful. Highly recommended!

                <div class="full">
                    Although I didn't get the opportunity to enjoy all the music they performed during my wedding, I absolutely loved their performance of Pachelbel as my dad and I walked down the aisle :) I was told that all the guests loved their music and that having them play at our wedding gave it the perfect touch of elegance. Their quality is great and their price was much more reasonable than other trios/quartets I could find. Thanks for sharing your wonderful music!

                    WOW!! Loved every moment and so thrilled we booked Arioso. Extremely professional, accomodating, and music was beautiful! Arioso was on top of all questions and replied to everything immediately. The special pieces that they were able to do for my daughter's wedding brought tears to my eyes that made the whole ceremony and cocktail hour the absolute best that I will never forget! Guests had high praises and will highly recommend to anyone who is not sure, to just book Arioso - you will be so happy you did! Great job Carol!

                    Carol and company were professional, accommodating, and extremely talented. They and a touch of elegance to or wedding. We had no rehearsal time, but did exactly what we wanted as if we practiced for months. I hope I need to hire them again. And with 5 girls I'm sure I will.

                    5 Stars! Arioso Quartet performed during my wedding ceremony and cocktail hour and everything went smoothly. Carol was a pleasure to work with in the weeks leading up to the ceremony. She sent me a demo CD so that I could hear some of Arioso's work which was great. Thanks Arioso!
