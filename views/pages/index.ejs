                The Arioso String Quarter is based in the Philadelphia area which includes the Main Line, Southern New Jersey, and the greater Delaware Valley region. In many cases the musicians are able to travel up to 75 miles from Philadelphia. The group, formed in 1989, consists of two violins, viola and cello.          <a href="biographies.html">The musicians</a> are seasoned professional performers and teachers, among the highest caliber in the area. <br><br>
                We also can provide you with a string trio 
                (violin, viola and cello), and you may substitute
                one violin in either group with a flute at no 
                additional cost.  The trio prices will be lower
                than the those of the quartet.&nbsp; We will tailor the
                group to your needs.<br><br>
                <i>ARIOSO</i> is <a href="rates.html">available</a> to 
                play weddings, parties, Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, and
                concerts at any location.  Our dress is formal black
                attire: long black dresses for women and tuxedos
                for men.<br><br>
                The locations we have played at include Greystone Hall, Merion Tribute House, the Four Seasons Hotel, the Ritz Carlton Hotel (now St. Regis), the DuPont Country Club, Philadelphia Cricket Club, Sugarloaf, Philopatrian Society, among many others. <br><br>
                We are experts at playing anything from a full 
                Catholic Mass (with or without singers) to jazz, 
                and have played ceremonies of every
